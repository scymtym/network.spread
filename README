* Introduction
  The cl-spread system provides a Common Lisp wrapper for the spread
  group communication system.
* Tutorial
  When using spread, the first step usually consists in establishing a
  connection to the spread deamon. The following example demonstrates
  this for a situation in which the spread daemon is running on the
  local machine and listening on port 5103:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defvar *connection* (spread:connect "5103"))
#+END_SRC
  After a connection has been established, data can be sent and
  received. However, in order to receive data, it is necessary to join
  the spread group to which the messages are sent. In the following
  code, the previously created connection joins a spread group called
  ="mygroup"= and tries to receive a message. The number of groups a
  given connection is a member of is evident from the printed
  representation of the connection instance.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (spread:join *connection* "mygroup")

  (spread:receive *connectoin* :block? nil)
#+END_SRC
